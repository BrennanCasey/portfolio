# About Me
I am soon to be graduating from my Masters in Business Intelligence & Analytics from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. I currently work for Walmart in a Supply Chain Analytics role and I am pursuing a Data Scientist career upon completion of my Masters degree in December 2020. I love taking on the biggest problems I can and seeing if technology can make a difference. 
My resume is available [here](https://github.com/BrennanCasey/portfolio/blob/master/Brennan Casey Resume.pdf).

# Data Science Portfolio
This is a repository for some of my machine learning projects along with applicable data science project such as visualization, data collection, and web scraping. 

_Note: I also have significant experience in task automation which is unavailable due to an honored Non-disclosure Agreement with my current employer. "No task done twice" _

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Cheaters in CS:GO](https://github.com/BrennanCasey/portfolio/blob/master/CSGO%20Analysis.ipynb): An end-to-end machine learning project where I collected data from public steam profiles, identified cheaters caught by Valve's anti-cheat system, and created models to predict the players using injected Aim-Assist Software or "AimBots".
	- [Amazon Review Rating Prediction](https://github.com/BrennanCasey/portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Review%20Prediction.ipynb): Using Pandas, NLTK, and Sci-Kit Learn to predict the rating of product reviews based on other scraped variables.
	- [Supervised Learning Template](https://github.com/BrennanCasey/portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Template.ipynb): This file is a useful starting point to test baseline Sci-Kit Learn models. After one has cleaned his or her data, this notebook can help test some of the most common supervised machine learning algorithms without having to write much code. Enjoy!
	
	Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib 


- ### Webscrapers: 

	- __Python__
		- [Amazon Review Scraper](https://github.com/BrennanCasey/portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Product%20Review%20Scraper.ipynb): Using Selenium to download all the reviews for a particular item on Amazon. After the reviews are downloaded, some additional features are added and the review text is processed with NLTK. 
		- [Scraping Yelp](https://github.com/BrennanCasey/portfolio/blob/master/Scraping%20Yelp.ipynb): Using Selenium, to scrape every location on Yelp, city-by-city, to acquire business names, addresses, coordinates, phone numbers, type of business, and more.  
		- [Scraping Lululemon](https://github.com/BrennanCasey/portfolio/blob/master/Scraping%20LuluLemon.ipynb): Using Selenium to download content from LuLuLemon to be added to a consumer catalog. 
	
	_Tools: Selenium, Docker, Twilio, NLTK
